# 13-gt-burger

## Description 

This application takes burgers stored in a MySQL database and allows the user to add to that database or devour burgers and change their state in the database. 

## Installation 

Run `npm install` after cloning the repo from my GitHub. Then, run node server.js in your terminal. If the Heroku deployed app is not functioning properly, feel free to run the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files in your MySQL workbench to test the code locally. 

## Usage 

This was designed to further explore ORMs and fully appreciate Sequelize when we get to it.

## Contributing 

This was a solo project completed for homework for the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. As always, the biggest shout-out to my classmates and TAs who are always ready to problem solve.
